## Problem Description:

A SPA (single page application) application developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people).

1. Display an image for each of the characters. Preferrably a unique image for each but you could also choose to use a dummy image for all of them.

2. An HTTP request was made to the star wars API and the result from the request was used to populate your frontend application

- A list with the names of each person from the API request.
- On Clicking any name, the details of that user is displayed on the screen, with name, gender, height only

3. All implementations was done using es6.

4. The SPA was made responsive using CSS grid.

5. The application is hosted on heroku (https://starwarscharsapi.herokuapp.com/)

6. The application is hosted on heroku (https://starwarscharsapi.netlify.app/)
